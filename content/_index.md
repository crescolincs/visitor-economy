     lead: >-
          Recent growth in Lincolnshire’s visitor economy has reflected the attractiveness of the region’s offer and the rising popularity of domestic tourism among UK residents, presenting investment and growth opportunities for businesses across the sector.
     body: >-
           - Prior to the coronavirus pandemic, Lincolnshire’s visitor economy experienced a sustained period of significant growth - increasing in value by a third between 2012 and 2017.
           
           - Between 2018 and 2019, notable increases were recorded in visitor days (exceeding 50 million in 2019), overall visitor numbers (exceeding 35 million in 2019), visitor expenditure, and the sector’s overall economic impact (reaching £730 million in 2019). 
           
           - By 2021, Lincolnshire’s visitor economy had bounced back strongly from the pandemic, although performance remained behind 2019. UK domestic tourism is projected to return to pre-pandemic levels in 2023, presenting an opportunity for the sector in Lincolnshire to revert to the robust growth of the pre-pandemic period.

           In the immediate pre-pandemic period, Great Britain’s (GB) domestic tourism sector saw growth across categories including overnight trips, holidays, VFR (visiting friends and relatives), and business.
     body: >-
           - Between 2018 and 2019, notable increases were recorded in GB overnight trips and expenditure; GB holiday trips; VFR trips, bednights and expenditure; and GB business trips expenditure. 
  
           - Although the coronavirus pandemic impacted Great Britain’s tourism sector significantly, these positive prior trends, in combination with the pandemic’s positive effect on the ‘staycation’ market, provide a solid basis for post-pandemic growth

   - heading: Lincolnshire - A Rising Challenger Destination
     image: visitor-economy-6.jpg
     lead: >-
           Lincolnshire is a rising challenger destination in Great Britain’s visitor economy. The area’s powerful visitor proposition aligns closely with key growth segments, creating profitable opportunities for companies across the sector.
     body: >-
           - While having a successful visitor economy and an attractive destination offer, Lincolnshire (along with the wider East Midlands region) currently achieves lower visitor spend than key competitor English regions with historically stronger tourism profiles. 
  
           - However, Lincolnshire is a rising destination with a powerful ‘City, Coast and Countryside’ proposition that aligns closely with key growth areas. These include the ‘empty nester’ and ‘older independent’ visitor segments, and holiday types including overnight/short stay, coastal/seaside, walking/hiking, countryside/village and smaller cities/towns.

           - Lincolnshire’s visitor proposition is further enhanced by significant cost advantages versus key competitor locations. According to 2022 research, Lincolnshire is the UK’s second most affordable visitor destination.

   - heading: Lincolnshire’s Visitor Economy Growth Drivers
     image: visitor-economy-4.jpg
     lead: >-
           Multiple factors are driving the growth of Lincolnshire’s visitor economy, including major investments in attractions and infrastructure; strategic government funding and support; a diverse events programme; and the area’s thriving education and industrial sectors.
     body: >-
           - Recent years have seen multi-million pound investments in Lincolnshire’s leading visitor attractions, with more than £50 million spent on Lincoln Cathedral, The International Bomber Command Centre, The North Sea Observatory, and Lincoln Castle alone. 
  
           - Key infrastructure investments include the England Coast Path in Lincolnshire. The completion of new sections, planned for 2023-24, is projected to boost visitor numbers - to walk, cycle or ride the trail - benefiting businesses across the visitor economy.

           - Lincolnshire has recently secured substantial new funding from the UK Government for projects that will boost the visitor economy, in areas including business capital investment, sustainable transport, heritage, urban regeneration and digital infrastructure.

           - Lincolnshire benefits from a diverse, year-round events programme, catering to a broad range of visitor demographics.

           - The fast-growing University of Lincoln, and booming regional industries including low carbon energy, agrifood and defence, are further benefiting Lincolnshire’s visitor economy.

     lead: >-
           Greater Lincolnshire’s regional, local government and tourism sector organisations are working as an integrated team to grow visitor numbers and create a profitable, low-risk environment for investing businesses.
     body: >-
           - **A Comprehensive Tourism Action Plan:** a five-year strategy for visitor economy growth, with a vision for developing Lincolnshire as a nationally and internationally important tourism destination, by supporting and developing local businesses and encouraging visitor spend. 
  
           - **Strategic Themes:** to make Lincolnshire an exemplar of sustainable tourism; to extend the tourism season; to enhance the visitor offer for a wider range of audiences; to improve sector business productivity; and to improve local infrastructure. 

           - **Delivery Tools:** developing and delivering a comprehensive sector skills training programme; creating a coordinated, networked marketing offer; coordinating survey information to develop an area-wide customer insight programme; maximising partnership working; and improving support for local businesses.

           - **Focused Market Positioning:** aligning the area’s distinctive strengths with high-growth visitor segments and holiday types, and projected key trends.

     lead: >-
           For investing visitor economy businesses, Lincolnshire presents profitable growth opportunities across a range of areas including hotels, pubs, other accommodation, attractions, and services.
     body: >-
           - **Hotels:** Based on growing demand for hotel accommodation and a more diverse hotel offer, identified investment opportunities include 4-star and boutique hotels, upper-tier budget hotels, and hotels in historic market towns. 2022 research showed a strong, post-pandemic bounce back in hotel occupancy rates and revenue per room.  
  
           - **Pubs:** Identified investment opportunities include: development of bedroom accommodation; upgrading of existing characterful pubs; refurbishment of existing properties; development of gastropubs with boutique bedrooms; development of new-build pubs with budget bedrooms; and provision of non-serviced accommodation at rural pubs. 

           - **Short-term Holiday Rentals:** 2018 Airbnb research identified the East Midlands (which includes Lincolnshire) as the 2nd fastest growing UK destination for guests using Airbnb. The data presents a clear case for investment in Lincoln - a leading historic city destination with significant demand, constrained supply and strong revenues.

           - **Sites for Major Visitor Economy Investments:** With large, cost-competitive sites, easy access to major population centres, and a growing tourism industry, Lincolnshire presents an attractive opportunity for businesses investing in major visitor attractions.

           - **Restaurants and Cafes:** With significant ongoing, strategic investment in market towns, infrastructure and visitor attractions, Lincolnshire presents opportunities for businesses to invest in restaurants and cafes across the area.
